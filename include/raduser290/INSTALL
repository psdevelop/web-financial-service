Installation Guide For Rad User Manager version 2.90

Database Installation.
----------------------
Create a database on your mysql server and run the database.sql script
included in this folder to create the necessary tables. Then you need
to create a mysql user account with insert,update and select privileges
on this database. 

Edit the config.php file in the inc/ folder to reflect these settings.
Additional help is available in the configuration guide in the docs 
folder. The config.php file itself is well commented.


Script Installation.
--------------------
Move the inc/ and members folders to your webspace. Open the URL that 
corresponds to the members/ folder with your browser. You should see a
login form. You can test the system with the default user account 
(user/radmin) to login. If you can log in to your system, the 
installation is successfull. You can then customize the User Manager by
editing the config.php file. 


Installing the admin section.
-----------------------------
Copy the admin section into the web space as above. Use the built in
administrative account (admin/radmin) to login. When logged in as the
administrator you will see an item labelled 'Manage Users' on your 
start page. Don't forget to change your default password.
